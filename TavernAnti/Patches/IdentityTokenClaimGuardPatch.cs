/// <summary>
/// Root-cause fix for the "set IsDeveloper to true" family of exploits, deeper than
/// DeveloperClaimGuardPatch: JWTUtility.CreateFromString - THE single decode path every
/// identity token in the entire codebase goes through - never validates a signature at all,
/// for any caller, regardless of its `includeRawData` flag (traced in full: it splits the raw
/// string on '.', base64-decodes only the middle/payload segment, parses it as JSON, and
/// builds a JwtSecurityToken directly from that - the header and signature segments are never
/// even read). Any player can hand-craft a token with any claims they want; nothing anywhere
/// in this codebase checks otherwise post-shutdown (see DeveloperClaimGuardPatch's doc comment
/// for why - TavernLib's own identity-token validation call is patched to always return true,
/// because there is no live Alta backend left to validate against).
///
/// DeveloperClaimGuardPatch closes this at UserRolesUtility.GetRolesFromIdentityToken, but that
/// only protects consumers that go through UserRolesUtility. It does NOT protect
/// ServerPlayerConnectionHandlerOld.CheckIfPlayerIsAllowed's separate "dev join token" branch
/// (~line 168), which reads the "Policy":"dev" claim directly off the JwtSecurityToken and, if
/// present, skips almost every other join check entirely (server_id match, server
/// whitelist/blacklist, connection limit, version check, duplicate-join check, and the
/// VR-headset-required check) - gated only on IsValidShortLivedIdentityTokenAsync /
/// IsValidIdentityTokenAsync, which likely also resolve to the same always-true validator.
///
/// Rather than trying to intercept every current and future consumer individually, this
/// patches the shared decode itself: before JWTUtility.CreateFromString runs, this rewrites
/// the raw token string to strip an unverifiable "Policy" claim (unless the token's Username
/// claim belongs to a TavernAnti operator), so every consumer - CheckIfPlayerIsAllowed's direct
/// claim check, UserRolesUtility, and anything else that decodes identity tokens - sees a
/// token that never had the claim in the first place. This makes DeveloperClaimGuardPatch's
/// own check largely redundant in practice (the claim won't survive this far for non-operators)
/// but it's kept as defense-in-depth in case some path decodes tokens another way.
///
/// Fails open by design: any parsing surprise leaves the token untouched rather than risking a
/// crash in the join/command pipeline. That means the worst case of a bug here is "no worse
/// than before this patch existed", not "server can't accept joins".

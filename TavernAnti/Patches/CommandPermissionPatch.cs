/// <summary>
/// Closes the arbitrary-console-command exploit (knowscheets' "runtimeconsole" reflects into
/// RuntimeConsole.RunCommandOnServer, which is just CommandSync.Instance.RouteCommand(cmd, null)
/// under the hood - the same call the legitimate "Run on Server" debug console button makes).
///
/// Confirmed by reading the decompiled source (not just inferred): CommandSync.RouteCommand
/// networks the command to the server via a MethodSync on EntityMessageType.SyncB. The server
/// receives it in CommandSync.SyncCommand(IPlayer player, Stream stream), which the IL2CPP
/// decompile only shows deserializing the string (the async continuation is lost to
/// decompilation). Separately, Alta.Console.CommandService.Handle(command, context) - the single
/// choke point ALL commands run through - when given context == null builds a default
/// CommandContext from the *server process's own logged-in account*
/// (ApiAccess.ApiClient.UserClient.LoggedInUserInfo), not from whichever player actually sent
/// the command. If SyncCommand's lost continuation falls through to Handle(cmd, null) rather
/// than building a context scoped to the sending player, any connected player can run commands
/// under the server's own identity - which matches the exploit's observed behavior exactly.
///
/// This patch doesn't depend on resolving that decompilation gap: it intercepts at
/// CommandService.Handle itself (the one place every path - local console, server console, and
/// the networked path - converges), and treats "networked command arrived with no context" as
/// the dangerous case regardless of exactly how SyncCommand's continuation gets there.
///
/// There is currently no accessible, verifiable source of per-player command permissions
/// (the game's real Policy claims live on the join-time JWT and aren't retained anywhere after
/// join completes) - see TrustedUserStore.IsOperator for why this ships as a coarser,
/// fail-closed check against a "owner" role in users.json rather than a full per-player
/// CommandContext reconstruction.
///
/// MANDATORY LIVE VERIFICATION before trusting this in DryRun=false: confirm on a real local
/// dedicated server that a non-operator client using the exploit's RunCommandOnServer
/// reflection call is actually denied here, and that legitimate operator use (server owner
/// console) still works.
